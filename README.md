# Machine Learning for Cybersecurity in Critical Infrastructure

This repository contains a graduate research paper from the Georgia Institute of Technology exploring how machine learning can strengthen cybersecurity defenses in critical IT infrastructure. The work proposes a three-layer ML security framework integrating:

- AI-enhanced penetration testing  
- Hybrid malware detection models  
- Unsupervised anomaly detection systems
